CyberMed bugs and issues
========================

Bugs should be reported to the bug tracker on the Sourceforge project page, at
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=200384&atid=973286

Bugs and issues listed here may not be up to date or be the same reported
at the bug tracker. As the bug tracker is a better tool for updates on issues,
users should look there first for information on bugs. Developers may find this
list useful, as the bug-related information contained here is usually more
technical than on the bug tracker.
