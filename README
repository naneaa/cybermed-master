CyberMed 
========

CyberMed is a powerful framework designed to assist the development of virtual
reality applications. It consists on various libraries that provide high level
access and programming, abstracting aspects such as evaluation, haptic
interaction and 3D visualization using OpenGL. Through a robust, high
performance database system, it is possible to import 3D models developed in
other packages (such as 3D Studio Max and Blender 3D) and apply deformations 
efficiently, enabling the creation of highly realistic aplications.

CyberMed is used mainly for virtual reality researches but is aimed to be the
defacto framework for interactive applications development. The package's
libraries may also be used separately, providing the developer with a high
level tool to enhance individual aspects of applications.

CyberMed is an open-source project continuously under development. Check the 
project site for news: http://cybermed.sourceforge.net
