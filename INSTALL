CyberMed Installation
=====================

This document describes the installation of the CyberMed package. 

CyberMed aims to provide a high level approach to the development of virtual
reality applications. It supports experience evaluation, haptic interaction,
stereoscopic visualization, mesh deformation and collision detection. 

CyberMed consists on various libraries that are installed in the system. The
package can be installed as a whole or may have libraries installed separately.

Previously to the installation
------------------------------

Make sure that you have already installed:
. glut and glut development packages
. c++ compiler
. opencv (for optical_trackers)


Installation from source code
-----------------------------

The source code can be downloaded from the SVN repository, located in
Sourceforge.net,

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/cybermed/

The package can be easily built and installed using the makefiles. It's

	./packmanager.sh install assess
	./packmanager.sh install collision
	./packmanager.sh install deformation
	./packmanager.sh install network
	./packmanager.sh install collaboration
	./packmanager.sh install haptics (this will only work with appropriate haptic device)
	./packmanager.sh install optical_trackers (this will only work with appropriate libraries and cam devices)
